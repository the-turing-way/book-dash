## Our report

### What did we do?

Our goal for the book dash was to bring together participants enthusiastic about reproducibility to contribute to and improve the *Turing Way* book during a one day collaborative event. 
We held a networking event the evening prior to the book dash for participants to get to know each other and promote any projects that they're working on, in order to have an intense 9 to 5 day working on the book.
There was a great diversity of lightning talks which were really fun:
* Rachael talked about the women in data meetup group that she organises in Manchester: HER+Data MCR. :woman_technologist:
* Beth revealed what you can and cannot get away with in roller derby! :women_wrestling:
* Jez spoke about the tradition of Morris dancing and his experience as a Morris dancer. üï∫
* Oli wowed us all with a performance of the *Jabberwocky* poem written by Lewis Carroll. üêâ
* Rosti pitched her Soapbox science plans taking place in Stoke-on-Trent. üî¨
* Alex described his Music and Machine Learning projects, as well as his students' project on using ML to classify Gender of voices (and the complications and biases involved). üé∂
* Greg emphasised that a great way to learn more about a sport is through statistics! üèÄ
* Kirstie impressed us with her experiences of dog training. üê∂
* Joe informed us about a bomb detector made from bees. üêù


During the dash, we set out to build upon the [Collaborations Workshop Hackday experience](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/workshops/collabw19/hackdayreport_20190403.md): we wanted to enhance the first version Turing Way project and ensure that contributing to the project is as straightfoward as possible.
We had a mixture of contributions including curating and editing existing content, expanding existing content and writing entirely new content:
* Many of the pull requests's below have been approved and published already!
* New content includes chapters on
  * Reproducible Data Analysis Pipelines for Machine Learning
  * Credit for Reproducible research
  * Code Styling for Reproducibility
* Improved the ease of contributing to the project through enhanced pull request/issue templates, search functionality and  continuous integration within the book.

Specifically:

* [gkiar](https://github.com/gkiar): 
  * Issue: [Expanding on FAIR Principles for Tools](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/471)
    * Currently only in the data management section but actually FAIR can apply to a bunch of different aspects of data science (tools, business management etc). Greg couldn't FIND FAIR in the first place which lead to a contribution to the jupyter book repository to add a search bar on each page. (When the day started there was only a way to go to a master search page rather than search from a page that you were reading.) 
  * Issue: [Adding a search bar?](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/472)
  * PR: [Adding search button on Jupyter Book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/pull/196)
