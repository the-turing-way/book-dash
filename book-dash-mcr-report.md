## Our report

### What did we do?


Specifically:

* [gkiar](https://github.com/gkiar): 
  * Issue: [Expanding on FAIR Principles for Tools](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/471)
    * Currently only in the data management section but actually FAIR can apply to a bunch of different aspects of data science (tools, business management etc). Greg couldn't FIND FAIR in the first place which lead to a contribution to the jupyter book repository to add a search bar on each page. (When the day started there was only a way to go to a master search page rather than search from a page that you were reading.) 
  * Issue: [Adding a search bar?](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/472)
  * PR: [Adding search button on Jupyter Book](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-book/pull/196)
