We are delighted to share that the eighth Book Dash was hosted successfully from 14 to 18 November 2022 with more than 30 participants, including our planning committee members, Trainers and Presenters. 

The Book Dash planning committee members were: Arielle Bennett, Emma Karoune, Esther Plomp and Lena Karvovskaya, who were supported by Anne Lee Steele and Malvika Sharan in their work.

Invited participants who attended the Book Dash event were (alphabetically): Aditi Dutta, Alden Conner, Alejandro Coca Castro, Aman Goel, Andrea Sánchez-Tapia, Anne Fouilloux, Batool Almarzouq, Danny Garside, Elisa Rodenburg, Jennifer Ding, Jim Madge, Johanna Bayer, Liz Hare, Mahwish Mohammad, Melissa Black, Pamela Villar Gonzales, Rachael Stickland, Saranjeet Kaur, Shern Tee, Winny Nekesa Akullo.

Patricia Herterich, Giulia Tomba and Elisee Jafsia, were among many community members who joined to hear from our Book Dash participants.

### Overview of themes and topics discussed during the Book Dash

Discussion and collaboration among the attendees at this Book Dash covered a wide range of topics including **Accessibility** in data science: Andrea, Liz, Anne, Malvika; **Data** (Management and wrangling): Mahwish, Rachael, Winny, Esther; **Localisation** and Translation: Batool, Pamela, Alejandro; **RSE roles**: Johanna, Shern; **Community** management: Malvika, Emma, Arron, as well as individuals tackling existing issues: Alden (research sustainability), Aman (documentation).

### Format of the event

_The Turing Way_ [Book Dash events](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash.html) are a less intense version of [Book Sprints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_sprint), where participants collaboratively work on _The Turing Way_ book synchronously to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. 
They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and take lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects.

The November edition of Book Dash featured 19 invited contributors, 6 committee members, 14 online working sessions, four discussions and social events, and two community share-outs.

In the past, we have organised 1-1.5 day-long Book Dash events in person or partially remotely. 
However, since November 2020, we have been hosting Book Dashes online and with multiple short co-working called development sessions spread over 5 days for flexible participation by members.
We developed this format to allow people in different time zones to participate with the same efficiency and equitable support. 
This involved creating multiple small development sessions throughout the day, adding dedicated sessions for informal social interactions, developing shared documents with all the information, providing support funds to ensure that everyone can comfortably participate and hosting a pre-event call to communicate these resources to everyone.

Like the previous Book Dash in 2022, this time we also had local hubs hosted in London and Amsterdam with modifications introduced for the in-person participants to plan their day offline.

### Application, Review and Selection process

As in the past, we invited applications through an open call where interested applicants could state their goals and interest in the Book Dash. This application was also open for the long-term members of the community who may have attended a Book Dash or Collaboration Cafes in the past to join as a helper and mentor for new contributors as well.

Applicants were asked to think about the collaborative element of the Book Dash and state how they could engage with other participants. 
To get a sense of the time zones these applicants came from, we asked them to choose their preferred slots during the day that they can join. You can see a template of this document [here](https://tinyurl.com/tw-bookdash-template).

The Book Dash Planning Committee used the rubrics (as explained in the [online chapter](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/bookdash/bookdash-application.html#reviewing-process)) to score the applications during the review. They met online to discuss applications, frame feedback and conclude their selection process.

At the end of the event, we asked our participants to share feedback anonymously in the ["Pluses and Deltas" HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@turingway/bookdash-nov2022-feedback).

We greatly appreciate the work that our attendees have accomplished in the project during this short event and thank them for their feedback, a few of which have been highlighted below.

* I enjoyed working in the hub and lovely to meet new people. 
* It was my first Book Dash and I was glad that I got support from the organisers and fellow participants in getting started. Everyone was super helpful to assist everyone get his/her work done. 
* This was my second book dash and I enjoyed working through it! The concept of the book dash is fantastic as it allows a chance for a lot of collaboration with the community and helps in coming up with better ideas and solutions. I also love the illustrations made by the Scriberia Artist! Looking forward to the next one!
* Enjoyed the Book Dash very much! Plan to come back again next time. :)
* It was a supporting and welcoming community that encouraged people to get tasks done, but with the understanding that lives, and jobs, are still happening around this book dash. The opportunity to work with the artist was special and interesting  - I've never had such an experience before. Such a diverse amount of valuable work is being done!
* It was my first Book Dash and I loved the experience! I felt so welcomed despite being new to the community! It was extra special contributing from halfway across the world, and the Book Dash team went all out to help us find slots that fit the time difference!
* First BookDash - learned about how the book and community operate
* Opportunity to have conversations; share and develop ideas together
* Accessibility: alt text for illustrated concepts, use of Etherpad
* It was my first Book Dash and I had a wonderful experience! It was great meeting so many new people and learning from them. Everyone was quite welcoming and it felt great to be a part of the community. I really enjoyed the various sessions and loved collaborating with the Scriberia artist. :) Already excited for the next Book Dash!
* It was my first BookDash and hopefully it won't be the last one! I really enjoy the structure, the time to work and all the possibilities! I am very happy I met such inspiring people and get to know more about other members. I really like the environment there, and the people organizing the event are fantastic and super welcoming! Looking forward to the next one and keep contributing to the Turing Way.

* Working in a hub - I think next time we should try to have two small rooms as we needed some place to take calls in breakout rooms. +1
* I know that if it is not online fewer people can attend, but I really think it would be beneficial to have the option of full in-person.
* It will be good to try to know in advance the topics, so the people that want to work together can try to adapt to the time of the other people (this would be fixed as well if everyone is in person)
* Claim the expenses during the Bookdash will be easier (so everything is sorted at the end), and I can imagine better for the organization.
