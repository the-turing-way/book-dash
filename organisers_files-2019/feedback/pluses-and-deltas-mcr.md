# Turing Way Book Dash: Pluses and Deltas - Manchester

### Pluses

Please add something you liked about the Book Dash. We might use these to advertise the Turing Way project and in impact reports for our funders. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the ðŸ¤« at the beginning of the line.



* It was great to be able to contribute despite not being confident, and I was always made to feel welcome for each small thing I tried to do! The supportive environment was absolutely key, and you nailed it! The illustrations were great and really motivating.
* Providing travel/accomodation was a very inclusive act and I think it was one of many encouraging points to attend and contribute to the Book Dash. :100: for both days!
* Learnt a great deal and everyone was very patient with my lack of knowledge!
* Very clear guidelines on how to get involved from the get go, made it easy to participate
* Felt exciting to be a part of something so important.
* Very generous with refreshments!
* Great session to learn and pick up new tips on Open Research. Both days were organised really well.
* Supportive environment - no such thing as as tupid question
* I liked the ice-breaker game
* Working with so many people who either loved working openly or were _so_ ready to learn ðŸ’•
* First opportunity to make a serious contribution to an open project and spend a firewalled chunk of time on it :rocket:
* Great mix of people involved with different expertise
* Many workshops claim to be a safe space but this genuinely felt like one.
* Great to see a supportive community at work in a room - felt everyone ended up with something to do that was really valuable and appropriate to their strenghts
* The artist in residence was amazing!
* Felt like a safe space
* Ice breaker was actually sort of fun, for once 
* o
* Everyone's enthusiasm and supportive approach
* Really loved having the artist in residence. It was so much fun to be able to talk about what we were working on and then see it appear on the wall!!

### Deltas

Please add something that you would change about the Book Dash. We've never run one before and so all of your comments will be really valuable. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the ðŸ¤« at the beginning of the line.

* Maybe have some circulation of tasks to get a bit of variety - I enhoyed what I did, but it could have been interesting to move around a bit more and work on different projects.
* I secretly wanted it to be longer even though I couldn't come for longer anyway... ðŸ˜† weekend might have been easier for me (but maybe not everyone else- I might be the odd one out!)
* A second day with the option of carrying on into the evening of day 1 would have let me get the most out of the time out of the office
* I would make it a two day event, but separated by some period of time (weeks?) so we had some time to mull over thoughts - particularly relevant for us writing the new chapter.
* I think the session could have improved by only slightly if a guidance on how to do certain tasks were provided before the Bookdash. However, this was covered during the session.
* A more comprehensive list of topics that could be added could have been helpful for those not sure what to contribue - often hard to think what would be useful from thin air
* Not long enough - it was hard to really sink your teeth in, in such a short amount of time
* Would've loved two days to really get into it!
* Two days would have been an ideal length of time.
* Probably an action I should have taken on myself but a quick online training session of GitHub before I arrived would have saved me time.
* A handout guide to GitHub would have been good to refer to.
* A little introduction to GitHub to kick off would probably be useful
* Probably could have done an all nighter with all of the pizza, sugar and coffee... I don't know what to do with myself now.
