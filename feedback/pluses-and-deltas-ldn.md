# Turing Way Book Dash: Pluses and Deltas - London

### Pluses

Please add something you liked about the Book Dash. We might use these to advertise the Turing Way project and in impact reports for our funders. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the ðŸ¤« at the beginning of the line.

* It was a great opportunity for me to be able to ask questions and learn new things while I was contributing to the book (continuous integration and travis in particular!)
* It was a very friendly atmosphere where everyone's contributions were really celebrated. People were very helpful in making sure that everyone could contribute (and the guidance on The Turing Way repo was really well thought through to facilitate that, too).
* Also, I felt well looked-after at the hotel/with the food. Thank you!
* How much everyone did! And to see people helping each other out with their issues
* Great to meet so many wonderful people, willing to share experiences and help eachother out.  Amazing vision and that it is all coming together, feel lucky to be a part of it
* The illustrations - I'd buy the Graphical-Novel Guide to Git(Hub)
* Very cool meeting people with such a range of skills and backgrounds :)
* Cool addition of scriberia drawings; we should add them into the chapters, unless this is already the plan of course
* Really collaboratives, as few events I have seen/been at; well done! Great team work, I mean the organizing team ;-)
* It was kinda eerie that the room was so quiet....but I think it was because everyone was working so hard! It's so inspiring to see how much a team of people working together can achieve in such a short day. I think we managed this because the networking dinner and lightning talks were such successful ice breakers that we could really get down to business on the Tuesday!
* It was exactly what we needed to put all of our research on how to do good outreach in "paper". I'm very happy to finally be part of the Turing Way book :)
* amazing people
* cool coffee machine
* great opportunity to do some focussed work on #TTW
* Great crowd. Amazing ideas floating in the room. Would have loved working on it one more day, but mybe that could be organised online.
* I like the inclusive nature of the project in all aspects -- I was glad that our outreach contribution was welcomed even if it wasn't exactly aligned with the main goal of reproducible data science (even if outreach is a valuable and useful thing that all scientists should be doing more of!)
* The variety of contributions is amazing - I loved learning from so many different perspectives
* Loved learning from so many people and spending all day co-working in a comfortable, informal, welcoming space!
* Loved being able to specifically set aside some time and bash out some work!
* The BinderHub illustration! :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes: 


### Deltas

Please add something that you would change about the Book Dash. We've never run one before and so all of your comments will be really valuable. If you do not want your comment to be added to the GitHub repository (and therefore be made public) please add the ðŸ¤« at the beginning of the line.

* Making 2.5 days maybe? Half day for intro and to familiarize with the system, one  day to work or structure of the chapters and sections, the second day to add content
* More time would have been great! Loved that I got to write a new chapter but also didn't get to check out other parts of the www
* Not sure how far people travelled from on the Monday, but could maybe have started at midday to get some extra time in?
* The need for more structure time (2 days?) to work in this environment to better establish being able to continue to add value remotely.  Definitely not complaining!  Think lots was achieved
* surprisingly difficult build process for a book on reproducibility should work without docker compose even thought that is already a big improvement (thx @Lachlan)
* the Travis-CI lag was a bit annoying since it takes forever to actually merge a PR (difficult when depending on changes by sb else; I'd probably do more planning/discussion next time, less actual PRs to reduce the burden on Travis ;)
* Next time (if I get selected to attend again) I will bring headsets with music to get 'in the zone' ;-)
* Better orgainization of the "how-tos" in advance. We could have gotten more done if we didn't spend all morning setting up the file structure for a new chapter. Maybe a script that automatically sets up a new chapter and updates all the necessary files could help with this? It seems like something that can take a few interactive inputs (for instance structure, titles of subsections) and creates the directory structure and files directly could ease this process.
* Kind of a back-handed complaint (if that's a thing, haha), but I would have liked more time.
* Waiting for travis was annoying. I'm still not sure if my PR has managed or not and since the event ends today, I'm not sure when I'll be able to fix it now.
* Having so many people all working on different things _kind of_ made it difficult to concentrate
