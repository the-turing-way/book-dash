# Manchester

We are looking forward to welcoming you to our Turing Way book dash in Manchester next week! 
We have a couple of things for you to look at before the workshop and some more information about what is happening on the day:

## Getting ready

We will ask you to contribute to the Turing Way GitHub repository.
Please sign up for a GitHub account if you don't already have one: https://github.com/join
If you're not familiar with contributing to GitHub projects, we recommend you read our chapter on [Collaborating on GitHub](https://the-turing-way.netlify.com/collaborating_github/collaborating_github.html).
Our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are also a good thing to read, but we will go through the main points again on the book dash day.
We hope you already have an idea of what you would like to contribute, but if you are still looking for inspiration, our [list of good first issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) will hopefully provide some inspiration.
